Generate is a fast, well-tested (more than 1,000 unit tests), and highly pluggable project generator for node.js. 

**Feature highlights**

- Generators can have gulp-style "tasks" (gulp plugins can be used too)
- Supports sub-generators, with any level of nesting!
- Generators can extend and use other generators
- Generators, sub-generators and their tasks can be run by command line or API
- Generate can be used as a node.js library, to add generate's functionality to other applications (for example, generate is used in [assemble][])

## Getting started 

### Install

To get started, you'll first need to install `generate` globally using [npm][], along with any generators you'd like to run.

**Install Generate**

{%= include("install-global") %}

***

## Usage

```sh
$ gen <command> [args]
```

## CLI
{%= docs('cli') %}

## API
{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## Task API
{%= depdocs("composer", "index.js") %}

## File System API
{%= depdocs("assemble-fs", "index.js") %}


## Authoring generators

_(TODO)_

### Generator naming conventions

**Do**

Use `generate-` as the prefix, followed by any words of your choosing to describe the purpose of the generator.

**Don't**

Use `generator-` as the prefix, since the word `generator` is already associated with yeoman.

## TODO

- [x] publish a fast, composable, highly extendable project generator with a user-friendly and expressive API
- [x] support sub-generators (to any level of nesting)
- [x] support streams, tasks, and plugins compatible with both [gulp][] and [assemble][assemble-core]
- [x] make it super easy to run specific tasks from any generator or sub-generator, programmatically or via CLI 
- [x] support _instance plugins_ that allow you to easily add functionality and features to generate
- [x] support any template engine
- [x] support using any number of template engines at once, so that different file types can simultaneously be handled by the engine that was registered for that file type
- [x] support templates as [vinyl][] files, simple to use template collections and lists (for pagination, sorting, groups etc)
- [x] support middleware that can be run on all files or specific files, and at specific points during the _build process_ (like `onLoad`, `preRender`, `postRender`, etc) 
- [x] 1,000+ unit tests
- [ ] create and publish generators (we created a handful of generators that we've been using locally, these will be published shortly)
- [ ] CLI docs (started)
- [ ] User help (e.g. when the user does `gen help` or just `gen`)
- [ ] API docs
- [ ] Generator guidelines and conventions

## Why Generate?

- Generate is an MIT licensed, open source project
- Generate was designed to be a faster, smarter, more extensible alternative to the current dominent solutions.
- Generate has an expressive, imperitive API. If you like gulp or express, you might like generate too.
- Generate is modular, and built on top of great libraries like [bach][], [composer][] and [assemble-core][]
