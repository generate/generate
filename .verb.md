This is a working application, but it's not ready to use. If you're curious about what we're building, feel free to ask questions or pitch in and help us make a better generator system for node.js. 

**Goals**

The goal of this project is to offer an alternative to Yeoman that is:

+ easier to use, and easier to author generators
+ faster and lighter (yeoman takes forever to load!)
+ should be composable and modular, allowing you to reuse logic across generators for things like:
  - tasks
  - plugins
  - middleware
  - loaders
  - templates
  - helpers
  - data
