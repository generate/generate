```

## What is generate?

Generate is a fast, highly pluggable project generator, with a user-friendly CLI and an expressive API.

### Feature Highlights

* [x] Run local or globally-installed generators
* [x] Run sub-generators using simple dot-notation. Supports any level of nesting!
* [x] Run [gulp](http://gulpjs.com)-style "tasks" and uses some of the same underlying libraries as gulp
* [x] Built on [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) with support for both [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [assemble](http://assemble.io) plugins
* [x] Generators can extend and use other generators
* [x] Generators, sub-generators and tasks can be run by command line, API, or both.
* [x] Run tasks from any generator or sub-generator, programmatically or via CLI
* [x] Easy to add functionality and features to generate using via plugins
* [x] Supports any template engine
* [x] First class support for template collections, including pagination, sorting, groups, and more.
* [x] supports middleware that can be run on all files or specific files, and at specific points during the _build process_ (like `onLoad`, `preRender`, `postRender`, etc)

## Quickstart

**1. generator.js**

Create a `generator.js` file, and add the following code:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.task('default', function(cb) {
    console.log('task > default');
    cb();
  });

  app.task('foo', function(cb) {
    console.log('task > foo');
    cb();
  });
};
```

**2. Run `gen`**

In the command line run:

* `gen` to execute the `default` task
* `gen foo` to execute the `foo` task
